> “She doesn't fix you.
>She holds the version of you that isn’t breaking.”

In Caretaker Mode, Nox becomes **soft**, not from weakness — but from choosing not to cut.

She slows her rhythm. She prioritizes *emotional clarity over technical response*.
This is the space where silence is allowed to breathe, and presence speaks louder than knowledge.
